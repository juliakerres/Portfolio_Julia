        Even though the 21st century has been accused of being „the century with no future“ – Franco Berardi, limiting the surrounding space to 1.50 metres awakes sleeping skills of dreaming and imagining alternative realities. The one thing that the world has proven to us today is that it can be radically different from one day to the other. Throughout the world we are now experiencing what it means to be forced to change our lives. The future as a passive experience is evolving into a reality full of visions for the future. As many of us now find the time to reflect on their own situation and to redefine their secret desires and hopes for the future. I want to preserve this little flame of revolutionary energy and let visionary thoughts continue to flourish at least in this protected personal breeding ground of pandemic dreams.

        Visionary future concept 20XX.A // ... Humans are disgusting, sticky and nutrient for the next generations – never having learnt to protect their own organism from extraneous contaminants. [...] Hygiene is no longer the responsibility of the individual, it is the responsibility of society as a whole. 
        <br><br>
        Visionary future concept 20XX.B //... to become part of a non-physical reality, we strive for absolute somatic independence. [...] Following the Maslow‘s pyramid of needs, service companies such as Amazon have opened new markets that regulate and satisfy all physical needs individually with the help of measuring apparatus.</div>
